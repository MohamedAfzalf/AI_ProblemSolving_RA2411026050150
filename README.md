## Problem 1 — Interactive Game AI (Tic-Tac-Toe System)

### Case Study

A gaming company wants to create an AI opponent for a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The AI always makes the optimal move. This implementation compares two algorithms — **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** — in real time.

### Algorithms Used

#### Minimax Algorithm

- Recursively explores **all possible game states** to find the optimal move
- Time complexity: **O(b^d)** where b = branching factor, d = depth
- Guarantees optimal play but explores every node — slower

#### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- Enhancement of Minimax that **prunes branches** that cannot affect the final decision
- Maintains two bounds: **α** (best for maximizer) and **β** (best for minimizer)
- If `β ≤ α`, the branch is pruned (no further exploration needed)
- Time complexity: **O(b^(d/2))** in best case — **up to 50–70% fewer nodes explored**
- Still guarantees the same optimal result as pure Minimax

### How to Run Locally

```bash
cd Problem1_TicTacToe
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Sample Output

```
User plays: X | AI plays: O
Algorithm: Alpha-Beta Pruning

Move 1 (AI): Cell 5 (center)
  → Nodes explored: 59 | Time: 0.8ms

Move 3 (AI): Cell 1 (corner)
  → Nodes explored: 12 | Time: 0.2ms

Result: DRAW (optimal play from both sides)

--- Performance Comparison ---
Alpha-Beta: 71 nodes  | 1.0ms total
Minimax:   255 nodes  | 3.4ms total
Pruning gain: 72.2%
```

### Features

- Choose to play as X or O
- Toggle between Minimax and Alpha-Beta in the same game
- Real-time node count and execution time display
- Winning cells highlighted
- Full move log

## Problem 11 — GPS-Based City Route Finder (A\* Algorithm)

### Case Study

A navigation system finds the fastest route between two city locations using an **informed search strategy**. The city is modeled as a weighted graph. The system uses the A\* algorithm with a heuristic to avoid exploring unnecessary nodes.

### Algorithm Used

#### A\* Search

- Informed search algorithm that combines **actual cost g(n)** and **heuristic estimate h(n)**
- **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**
  - `g(n)` = cost from start to node n
  - `h(n)` = estimated (heuristic) cost from n to goal
  - `f(n)` = priority used in the min-heap open set
- Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** — always expands the lowest f(n) node
- Guarantees optimal path when h(n) is **admissible** (never overestimates actual cost)
- **More efficient** than BFS/DFS/UCS for large graphs with good heuristics

### How to Run Locally

```bash
cd Problem11_GPSRouteFinder
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Sample Input (Assignment Example)

```
Graph:
  A → B (1), C (4)
  B → D (2), E (5)
  C → D (1)
  D → F (3)
  E → F (1)

Heuristic h(n) to goal F:
  A:7, B:6, C:4, D:2, E:1, F:0

Start: A  |  Goal: F
```

### Sample Output

```
A* Search Result:
  Optimal Path: A → B → D → F
  Total Cost:   1 + 2 + 3 = 6

  Nodes Explored (order): A, B, C, D, F
  Nodes on path:  A, B, D, F
  Nodes pruned:   C, E

  Execution time: 0.04ms
```

### Features

- Preloaded graphs: Assignment example + Indian Cities network
- Dynamically add nodes and edges through the UI
- Color-coded path visualization (blue = on path, red = explored but pruned)
- Heuristic table displayed alongside results
- Handles disconnected graphs (no path found message)
